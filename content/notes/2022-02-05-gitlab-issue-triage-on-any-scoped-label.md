title: GitLab Issue Triage on Any Scoped Label

The GitLab Triage Project doesnâ€™t directly support performing an action on any scoped label without having to list all
label scopes in the [condition][rubydoc.info:gitlab-triage:conditions-field]. This issue can be worked around by using
the [ruby condition][rubydoc.info:gitlab-triage:ruby-condition] and checking if any label exists that matches
`/^<label>::.+$/` as shown below.

```yaml
resource_rules:
  issues:
    rules:
      - name: Action for any severity label scope
        conditions:
          ruby: |
            resource[:labels].grep(/^severity::.+$/).any?
```
