title: GitLab Issue Triage for Moved Issues

When moving an issue in GitLab to a new Project, the original issue is closed and a new issue is opened. This means that
issues that these issues might be reopened for an unwanted reason. The GitLab Triage Project doesnâ€™t directly support
[checking][rubydoc.info:gitlab-triage:conditions-field] if an issue has been moved. This workaround for this is to check
if the [issue resource][docs.gitlab.com:api:issues] has a field `moved_to_id` that's neither nil nor zero.

```yaml
resource_rules:
  issues:
    rules:
      - name: Closed issues that haven't been moved
        conditions:
          ruby: |
            moved_to_id = resource[:moved_to_id]
            moved_to_id.nil? || moved_to_id.nonzero?
```
